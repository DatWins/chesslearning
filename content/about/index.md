Hi, I’m Joe Gonwa. I’m a product manager, writer, and runner who builds things on the web and thinks a lot about how we live and work.

This site is my digital workspace—a place for writing, reflections, side projects, and reading logs. I’m interested in systems, simplicity, technology, and the human condition.
